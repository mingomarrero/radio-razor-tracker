Radio Razor – Invoice Tracker (GitHub Pages ready)
How to publish:
1) Create a new GitHub repo (public or private with Pages enabled).
2) Upload the files in this folder (index.html, 404.html, favicon.ico).
3) In Repo Settings → Pages, set Source to 'Deploy from a branch', pick 'main' and '/ (root)'.
4) Wait for Pages to build, then open the URL it shows.

Tip: If you see caching, append ?v=1 to the URL.
